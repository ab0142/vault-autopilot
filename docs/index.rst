========

  Vault Autopilot's effectiveness is rooted in its use of manifest files. These
  files enable you to define the desired state of your Vault, encompassing
  secrets, policies, and other resources, in a clear and concise manner. By
  embracing a declarative approach, you no longer need to manually execute
  commands to create, update, or delete Vault resources. Instead, Vault
  Autopilot automatically applies the required changes to attain your desired
  state, ensuring a seamless and effortless experience.
